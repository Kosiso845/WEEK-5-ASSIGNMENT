#AI Case Study: Predicting Patient Readmission within 30 Days
This repository contains the full implementation of a practical AI case study aimed at predicting hospital patient readmission within 30 days. It includes preprocessing pipelines, model training, evaluation, and ethical reflections based on a realistic healthcare scenario.
 Case Study Overview
- **Problem**: Predict which patients are likely to be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression (interpretable for healthcare).
- **Data**: Synthetic adaptation of the Breast Cancer Dataset from Kaggle and structured hospital-like features.
